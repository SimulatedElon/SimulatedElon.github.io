        <p>
          This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online.

          How do we protect visitor information?
        </h5>

        <p>
          Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h5>
          Cookies
        </h5>

        <p>
          Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We use cookies to understand and save user's preferences for future visits.

        <br />

        <h5>
          Third Party Disclosure
        </h5>

        <p>
          We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include app hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our app, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.
          However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h5>
          Third Party Links
        </h5>

        <p>
          Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our app. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h5>
          Google and Mixpanel
        </h5>
        <p>
          We have implemented remarketing with Google AdSense. Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. We use Google AdSense Advertising on our app. Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

          Additionally, your activity on this app is anonymously collected strictly for improving the app. SimulatedElon uses the tool Mixpanel for tracking broad user data so that the development team knows which areas of the app should be polished. This meta-data is never shared with third-parties.
        </p>

        <h5>
          COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
        </h5>
        <p>
          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of apps and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under 13.
